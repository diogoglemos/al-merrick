                    Since 1969, Channel Islands Surfboards has been dedicated to performance and quality through hard work, 
                    innovation, and originality. Over the last 50 years, Channel Islands has grown from a local grass-roots 
                    operation to a cutting edge organization, catering to the best surfers in the world. It started with hard-core 
                    surfing and quality in mind and these guidelines have brought us through four decades of constant change 
                    in the surf industry. Channel Islands will shape the new millennium with innovative design and quality as our 
                    main focus.

                    Channel Islands Surfboards was created by Al and Terry Merrick in 1969. From his birth, Britt spent his days 
                    in the factory by the beach in Santa Barbara, from toddling around blanks to sweeping out shaping rooms. 
                    Eventually he started shaping alongside his father Al in 1990. He is now the lead shaper and designer for CI 
                    and carries on the family tradition of developing high performance board designs collaborating with the 
                    world's greatest surfers. From Tom Curren, to Dane Reynolds, Channel Islands continues to evolve with the 
                    highest standard of surfing.
