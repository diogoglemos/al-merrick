                    Channel Islands Surfboards was created by Al and Terry Merrick in 1969. From his birth, Britt spent his days in the factory by the beach in Santa Barbara, from toddling around blanks to sweeping out shaping rooms. Eventually he started shaping alongside his father Al in 1990. He is now the head shaper and designer for CI and carries on the family tradition of producing high performance board designs collaborating with the world's greatest surfers. From Tom Curren, to Dane Reynolds, Channel Islands continues to evolve with the highest standard of surfing.
